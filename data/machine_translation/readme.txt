To download the data of 100,000 translations used in the example, run ./get_mt.sh.

You can also download the full raw data, originally found at 

    http://www.statmt.org/europarl/

by running ./get_mt_raw_data.sh.
The raw data comes in a tar file with a run.sh script that will process it into the same data
you get with ./get_mt.sh. Note that you will need to install the Moses suite from

    https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder

to tokenize the data.
